hwloc2nffg
==========

Converts hwloc data (hierarchical map of computing and network elements)
to an NFFG representation in JSON format. This data can be processed by
an orchestrator. 

Requires a C99 compiler (GCC/CLANG preferred),
a make system (GNU Make preferred) and pkgconfig.

Hwloc and libjson-c developer packages must be installed.
On Debian Jessie they are called libhwloc-dev and libjson-c-dev.

Compile:
make

Run:
./bin/hwloc2nffg > mynffg.json
